Project Discussion

***

1. The entire application is implemented using PHP
2. HTML forms the skeleton of the document
3. CSS is written is sass format under css dir
4. JQuery is implied under form validation for user registration
5. Ajax handlex the form response across user registration page
6. Bootstrap 4 is implied to make the page responsive
7. User data is stored across MySQL database and data.json file
8. The application is hoted on Heroku platform

Note

***

- Login and Update are handled by form action due to invalid response of ajax pipeline across the pages
- While the application is hosted across heroku the mysql db is hosted in freemysqlhosting due to restriction along my account's permissions.
